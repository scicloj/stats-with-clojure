Florence Nightingale worked for the British Army in the Crimea war. This was the chart she produced which illustrated the cause if death of fighting soldiers.

If you see the above picture, the blue ares in the pie chart dominates. They represent soldiers not dying in war, but they are the count of soldiers who died due to preventable diseases.

The ares of the red wedges represents the deaths from wounds, and black wedges are from other causes.

It's shocking that when a person goes to war, he may not die fighting, but he may die falling prey to disease.

Florence Nightingale's illustrations, made the people higher up understand the gravity of the situation, and one can safely say she played some part in promoting hygiene and health in medical practices we follow today which has saved numerous lives.

The point here is the people who we accuse of not understanding the toil of commoners, might understand the gravity of the problem, if the data is presented in a right way.
