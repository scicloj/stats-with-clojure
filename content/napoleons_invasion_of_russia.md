## Napoleons Invasion of Russia

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia>

Napoleon's invasion of Russia is a disastrous one. Russians did not really fight Nepoleon, they were smart, they let him reach Moscow and Moscow was deserted. Napoleon waited in Moscow for word of surrender and nothing happened. Napoleon realized that he had been trapped and had to return to France before the onset of winter.

His troops weren't prepared for winter, and while traveling back many died. The picture above is a great postmortem visualization of his troop numbers. It shows roughly the path the troops tool from France to Moscow. The path is shown in brown, the width of the path is proportional to the strength of the troops. The path traced in black are the path back from Russia to France. You can see how the black path is narrow, representing the reduced troop numbers.

While returning, a lot of troops died in the cold, so the return path in black is traced below the march forward path in brown, and below the return path, you could see the corresponding winter temperatures. You could see while the troops were returning how the temperature dwindled and how the width of the kine shrinks because of it.

This is a genius visualization which gives you lot of information about the troop size, position, the direction they traveled and how the weather affected them. Though we have computers today, I am not sure if we could produce such a good maps with mapping API's we have.
